        "Dealing with mobile devices hardware is not easy, and the camera sensor is one of the most frustrating tasks. This is because of its intrinsic complexity, but also because of the uncomfortable design of the Android SDK APIs and the manufacturer-specific differences between sensors and the devices they belong to.",
        "My project, named <a href=\"https://natario1.github.io/CameraView\">CameraView</a>, was born out of this frustration and has received growing interest over the years, until becoming one of the most popular camera interfaces among Android developers. Besides being able to communicate correctly with the camera sensor, the library also includes support for business-critical features like real-time OpenGL ES filters, watermarks, overlays and efficient real-time processing.",
        "This tool powers hundreds — if not thousands — of live applications and has recently received support and trust by India's giant <a href=\"https://sharechat.com/\">ShareChat</a>, a social mobile app with over 100 million downloads, in which CameraView does a critical job."

        "Processing media files is a heavyweight task. Whether it's video processing, cropping, transcoding, trimming or applying filters — whenever performance is involved, it is of utmost importance to perform these tasks in a hardware-accelerated fashion to complete them in a reasonable amount of time.",
        "On Android devices, this goal is achieved by working with <code>MediaCodec</code> APIs and managing the raw buffers of data, using OpenGL ES for processing video frames, if needed. I am the author and maintainer of Open Source utilities to help in the process. My <a href=\"https://natario1.github.io/Transcoder\">Transcoder</a> library, for instance, is capable of decoding video files and reassembling them together with many advanced options. It can also be tweaked to support video filters or audio processing effects.",
        "Just like <a href=\"#camera\">CameraView</a>, this tool has received enterprise support and is currently used within <a href=\"https://sharechat.com/\">ShareChat</a>, a social mobile app with 10 million daily active users. Recently, I have also applied the same principles to GIF files and released <a href=\"https://natario1.github.io/GIFCompressor\">GIFCompressor</a>, a hardware-accelerated GIF-to-MP4 converter."

        "Both my <a href=\"#camera\">camera</a> and <a href=\"#media\">media processing</a> works have led me to improve my EGL and OpenGL ES skills, which are fundamental for managing the camera preview, processing camera frames, editing videos and applying real-time effects.",
        "I am far from being an OpenGL expert, but I know how to use it for the above mentioned tasks and this can greatly improve the performance of the application with respect to other solutions. It also gives great flexibility that can be used creatively. Out of this interest, I have developed <a href=\"https://natario1.github.io/Egloo\">Egloo</a> — a Kotlin wrapper around GLES APIs that helps in managing the EGL context and performing simple drawing operations, by using object-oriented components that are familiar to every Android developer.",
        "Egloo is still in development but the overall goal is to make simple tasks <em>simpler</em> from the perspective of an Android developer, thus reducing the very steep learning curve of OpenGL. This tool powers all of the libraries that were mentioned above, so it is used by millions of end users as well."

I have experience in building UI components that are both beautiful and functional, and I enjoy the process of designing and refining them to provide the right experience to the end user.",
        "In Android, this often boils down to being comfortable with the <code>View</code> system and the Android SDK internals, including meaningful animations, responsiveness to touch events, optimizing the measuring and drawing pipeline of each component.",
        "<a href=\"https://natario1.github.io/ZoomLayout\">ZoomLayout</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/natario1/Elements\">Elements</a> are just a few Open Source examples of my work in this area. The former is a flexible abstraction around touch event streams that provides two-dimensional zoom and pan behavior into all kinds of custom views (like <code>ViewGroup</code>, <code>ImageView</code>, or <code>Surface</code> streams). The latter is a collection of reusable, coordinated, modular components for <code>RecyclerView</code>. Both are written in Kotlin."
