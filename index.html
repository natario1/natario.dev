          <p>
            I am a 28-years old professional developer specialized in mobile applications and tools.
            I have been working as an Android engineer for many years, during which I have developed
            recognition in my field, especially within the Open Source community.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tools I develop are used by tens of millions of end users every day.
            I am the author and maintainer of several popular projects in the Android community,
            most notably the <a href="https://natario1.github.io/CameraView">CameraView</a> library.
            My experience and interests span many areas of development — from functional UI/UX to
            low-level graphics, device hardware and media.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website is meant to showcase some of my work. If you or your company need support,

            Dealing with mobile devices hardware is not easy, and the camera sensor is one of the most frustrating tasks.
            This is because of its intrinsic complexity, but also because of the uncomfortable design of the Android SDK APIs and
            the manufacturer-specific differences between sensors and the devices they belong to.
          </p>
          <p>
            My project, named <a href="https://natario1.github.io/CameraView">CameraView</a>, was born out of this frustration
            and has received growing interest over the years, until becoming one of the most popular camera interfaces
            among Android developers. Besides being able to communicate correctly with the camera sensor, the library also
            includes support for business-critical features like real-time OpenGL ES filters, watermarks, overlays and
            efficient real-time processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            This tool powers hundreds — if not thousands — of live applications and has recently received support and trust
            by India's giant <a href="https://sharechat.com/">ShareChat</a>, a social mobile app with over 100 million downloads,
            in which CameraView does a critical job.

        <!-- media -->
        <div class="skill-container text-justify" id="media">

          <p class="mt-4">
            Processing media files is a heavyweight task. Whether it's video processing,
            cropping, transcoding, trimming or applying filters — whenever performance is involved,
            it is of utmost importance to perform these tasks in a hardware-accelerated fashion
            to complete them in a reasonable amount of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Android devices, this goal is achieved by working with <code>MediaCodec</code> APIs and managing
            the raw buffers of data, using OpenGL ES for processing video frames, if needed.
            I am the author and maintainer of Open Source utilities to help in the process.
            My <a href="https://natario1.github.io/Transcoder">Transcoder</a> library, for instance,
            is capable of decoding video files and reassembling them together with many advanced options.
            It can also be tweaked to support video filters or audio processing effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like <a href="#camera">CameraView</a>, this tool has received enterprise support
            and is currently used within <a href="https://sharechat.com/">ShareChat</a>,
            a social mobile app with 10 million daily active users. Recently, I have also applied
            the same principles to GIF files and released
            <a href="https://natario1.github.io/GIFCompressor">GIFCompressor</a>, a hardware-accelerated
            GIF-to-MP4 converter.

        <!-- OpenGL -->

          <p class="mt-4">
            Both my <a href="#camera">camera</a> and <a href="#media">media processing</a> works have led me to
            improve my EGL and OpenGL ES skills, which are fundamental for managing the camera preview, processing
            camera frames, editing videos and applying real-time effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am far from being an OpenGL expert, but I know how to use it for the above mentioned tasks
            and this can greatly improve the performance of the application with respect to other solutions.
            It also gives great flexibility that can be used creatively. Out of this interest, I have
            developed <a href="https://natario1.github.io/Egloo">Egloo</a> — a Kotlin wrapper around GLES APIs
            that helps in managing the EGL context and performing simple drawing operations, by using
            object-oriented components that are familiar to every Android developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Egloo is still in development but the overall goal is to make simple tasks <em>simpler</em>
            from the perspective of an Android developer, thus reducing the very steep learning curve of OpenGL.
            This tool powers all of the libraries that were mentioned above, so it is used by millions of end users as well.

            UI and UX design is a fascinating field that I have been interested in since the beginning
            of my career. I have experience in building UI components that are both beautiful and functional,
            and I enjoy the process of designing and refining them to provide the right experience to the end user.

            In Android, this often boils down to being comfortable with the <code>View</code> system and the Android SDK internals,
            including meaningful animations, responsiveness to touch events, optimizing the measuring and drawing pipeline
            of each component.

            <a href="https://natario1.github.io/ZoomLayout">ZoomLayout</a> and <a href="https://github.com/natario1/Elements">Elements</a>
            are just a few Open Source examples of my work in this area. The former is a flexible abstraction around touch event streams that provides
            two-dimensional zoom and pan behavior into all kinds of custom views (like <code>ViewGroup</code>, <code>ImageView</code>, or <code>Surface</code> streams).
            The latter is a collection of reusable, coordinated, modular components for <code>RecyclerView</code>. Both are written in Kotlin.

            I have worked at front-end products for many years, both for commercial apps and personal projects.
            I have a taste for UI/UX and graphic design and write clean, testable and reusable code.
            I am familiar with the whole process of building an application, from the Proof-of-Concept stage to
            development, scaling, testing and deploying to the app store.

            The <a href="https://picme.chat">PicMe</a> application, currently in early beta stage, is a good example of my
            front-end work on the UI, UX, graphical and engineering side. It is a personal project that I push forward
            in my free time and I am the only person behind its website, graphics, concept, and well-tested Kotlin codebase.
